            //c.Create a dictionary to store the mapping between the original URLs and their corresponding short codes.
            //d.Implement a method to shorten a given URL using the designed algorithm and store the mapping in the dictionary.
            //e.Add a method to retrieve the original URL from a given short code by looking it up in the dictionary.
            //f.Prompt the user to input a URL to shorten or a short code to expand.
            //g.Use the created methods to shorten or expand the input URL / short code and display the result.
